=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

Templates have some advantages over direct DOM manipulation. Leverage those strengths in the blog, and in your portfolio application, by adding in a templating library! We use templating to abstract away the tiresome work of DOM rendering, and this practice is applied in many front-end libraries and frameworks.

## Daily Plan

- Notes:
  1. What's top of mind?
  2. How was our code review format yesterday?

- Code Review
- RegEx Intro - regex101.com
- HTML Templating / Handlebars.js
  - client-side vs server-side templating
- ES6 feature intro: Template Literals
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Identify different approaches to reusable HTML templates

* Effectively use templates to present user-entered (or server-provided) data (methods on the Handlebars object).

* Distinguish between the different Handlebars expression types ( **{{}}** vs **{{{}}}** ).
