=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

Databases power web applications everywhere by enabling them to persist, modify, and query datasets to great effect. While there are many types of database options available now, Structured Query Language (SQL) remains the de facto standard for communicating with relational database systems. Let's build some SQL skills!

- View today's and tomorrow's classes and labs as a big two-part structure. It's all the same basic subject, but way too much for one day, so we've split it.
- Reminder: There is **NO** portfolio assignment associated with today, so that means you can set that aside briefly (other than getting caught up...), and tomorrow's portfolio assignment is another peer review that's you'll do with your assigned lab partner for Friday.

## Daily Plan

- Notes:
  - Admissions: Next Steps! (1-115p)

- Code Review
- Lets build an express server again...
- SQL/Postgres Intro
  - SQL shell/raw SQL
- Node Postgres Package (PG)
- Lab Preview
