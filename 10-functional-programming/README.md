=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

The focus of this class is on basic functional programming concepts, through the use of the following array methods: `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`.

## Daily Plan

- Notes:
  - Lets talk about the meetup action last night?
  - Anyone want to tell the group about a new relationship you made last night?


- Code review
- Functional Programming
  - ForEach, Filter, Map, Reduce
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand advantages of functional programming and reasons for its recent rise in popularity
* Correctly use **.forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce()** array methods to explore a data set
* Construct modularity with IIFE patterns
