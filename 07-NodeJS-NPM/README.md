=======

## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

Things are starting to change in a big way as we start looking at how server-side code works. The core lab task today is to build out a server.js file using Express that will replace the functionality students have been getting from live-server up to this point.

*Note: Today's lab is another one that is on the lighter side, but starting tomorrow, the next three labs are probably the toughest of the course. Resist the temptation to coast once you've completed today's lab! Make sure that you understand EVERYTHING in the starter code inside and out!!!*
